## Customization

Semi provides a complete theme configuration process, which not only maintains the uniformity and coherence of colors, fonts, rounded corners, shadows, layouts, etc. in the visual language, but also meets the diversified visual needs of the business and the brand. You can go to [Semi Design System Management Site](https://semi.design/dsm/) to choose or create a theme style that meets your needs. Currently [Semi Design System Management Site](https://semi.design/dsm/) supports the configuration of theme colors, including fonts, rounded corners, etc.


### Create a theme

You can also start from a published theme, or choose **Create Now** to create a new theme, or you can update a published theme. After selecting the main color, our color algorithm will generate a set of highly available color wheels for you. On this basis, you can modify common variables and produce corresponding theme packages. One-click publishing can be pushed to bnpm.

## Access topic

After the theme is created and downloaded, the Semi plug-in can be used to quickly access the selected theme.

After downloading the theme, publish the npm package by yourself. (Temporary behavior, the platform outsourcing function will be launched soon).

Then you need to specify the theme to be used in the configuration file.

### When using webpack as a build tool

For users who use webpack, add the `theme` parameter to SemiWebpackPlugin.

SemiWebpackPlugin  `yarn add -D @douyinfe/semi-webpack-plugin` or `npm i -D @douyinfe/semi-webpack-plugin`

```jsx
new SemiWebpackPlugin({
    theme: `Your theme npm package name`
    /* ...options */
});
```
### Make changes to component-level variables take effect

If you modify the component-level variables in the process of customizing the theme, the `theme` field needs to be configured with the following configuration to make the changes take effect:
```javascript
{
    theme: {
        name:'Your theme npm package name',
        include:'~Your theme npm package name/scss/local.scss'
    }
}
```


## Update theme

During the development of Semi, it is possible to update or add some common variables for design considerations. If you are using a customized theme, when Semi has released a new universal variable (we will mark it in the update log), we recommend that you go to [Theme Store](https://semi.design/dsm/) to regenerate the theme.
