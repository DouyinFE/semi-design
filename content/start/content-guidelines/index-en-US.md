## Voice and Tone

### Who will use our Guidelines and Principles?

Any role that engages in user-facing communication should follow the principles of voice and tone, such as: Product Manager, UX Writer, Developer, Designer, Marketer, … pretty much everyone.

### Difference between Voice and Tone

Voice conveys the brand's unique point of view, perspective and identified values, that is, the personality of the product. The audience may be different, but our tone and personality remain the same. Tone is how a brand chooses to communicate with its users, including words, communication styles, and emotional attitudes. Our tone of voice will vary in different given scenarios.

### Voice

As a modern, lightweight design system, we hope that every product created with Semi can also impress users with efficient expression. Based on this, we have established the following three principles as the brand voice: direct and clear, honest, helpful.

![semi voice](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/ptlz_zlp/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/root-web-sites/semivoice-en.png)

<CustomH4>Direct and Clear</CustomH4>

In order to help users complete their tasks efficiently, we usually communicate information directly, clearly and concisely.

<CustomH4>Honest</CustomH4>

Speak like a human, be empathetic, stand with users and help users solve problems.

<CustomH4>Direct and Clear</CustomH4>

We anticipate the real needs of users and provide assistance and information at the right time.

### Tone

Our tone of voice adapts to different situations, just as you might change your tone when talking to a close friend or celebrating an important moment. We also adjust the tone when guiding users through a new feature, or telling them something doesn't work, or when they've completed a task. The following framework helps us determine the appropriate tone for each situation:

<CustomH4>Neutral</CustomH4>

Most of the time users want to complete their daily work quickly on the platform, and the copy we provide at this time is informative and useful.
> Example:  Add an image to a blank section to start building your website.

<CustomH4>Celebratory</CustomH4>

In some cases, we want to acknowledge that someone has completed a complex activity or difficult task. While we don't need to celebrate achievements, we should recognize the time and effort they put in. Depending on the level of effort, these might be simple confirmations or more aggressive acknowledgments that they accomplished something difficult.
> Example:  <ul><li> A slight celebration, the delivery action is complete: the file has been uploaded. </li> <li>A heavier celebration, suitable for completing complex tasks and giving users a sense of accomplishment: congratulations! You are a member of AnyWeb</li></ul>

<CustomH4>Sympathetic</CustomH4>

When users see an error message, they may get frustrated, their goal is to solve the current problem, and we hope to be able to show the problem directly and tell the solution (not recommended to use the sorry tone).
> Example:  The URL is not available. Contact the site administrator for help.

<CustomH4>Helpful</CustomH4>

Some people will want to be guided through the process step by step, while others may just want to try it out and learn on their own. Find ways to give them two options.
> Example:   Ready to create your first website? Get started with a 3-step trick.

<CustomH4>Authoritative</CustomH4>

Used in policy violations; such as when users engage in unacceptable behavior on the platform.
> Example:   Your site "Daily Coffee News" has been removed for policy violations.

### Writing principles

<CustomH4>Be consistent</CustomH4>

Consistency can make your product easier to understand. If a function/action is expressed in multiple ways, it will cause ambiguity to users. Every time you use a term or phrase appropriately and consistently, its meaning is strengthened.

- using terminology

    </tbody>
</table>

- Use consistent nouns and verbs
Using different nouns, then the user will not be sure if the new word refers to the same thing. With different verbs, users may be unsure if a click will lead to the same result. Teams can sort out nouns or verbs that mean the same thing and choose one

### 2. Acronyms 

- If an abbreviation with a business attribute is used for the first time in a text paragraph, it can be directly explained through the text
  - Example:  Service Level Agreement (also known as SLA)
- If it is used in a component, it can be explained in the form of interaction of the component
  - Example:  Machine translation acronym for Starling 

![acronyms](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/ptlz_zlp/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/root-web-sites/acronyms.png)

- Capitalize all letters

| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage |  
| --- | --- |   
| Create a new SLA| Create a new sla|      


- Special scene: When displayed as an extended word, use lowercase letters for display

| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage |  
| --- | --- | 
| "image 12.png" failed to upload | "image 12.PNG" failed to upload | 

### 3. Active vs. Passive Voice 

- Active voice emphasizes who or what is doing the action
- Passive voice emphasizes the object being manipulated

In most cases, we recommend using the active voice because it provides greater clarity, reduces complexity, and sounds more like everyday conversation than passive voice. We can also use the passive voice when it doesn't matter who did the operation, or when the passive voice sounds more natural than the active voice (for example, verbs like publish or assign, and nouns like discount).

| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage | 
| --- | --- |   
| Eric uploaded a video. | The video was uploaded by Eric. | 
| After you've added a product, click Save.| After the product has been added, Save must be clicked. | 

| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage |  
| --- | --- |   
| Anyweb has published your website. | Your website was published. | 
| We have removed our LIVE video due to a policy violation.| Your LIVE video was removed due to a policy violation. |                     

### 4. Articles 

The use of articles ("the", "a", "an") in titles and copy depends on the situation. The situation is divided into whether the information to be expressed is conversational or call-to-action. Avoid using articles in buttons and labels.

<CustomH4>Conversational messages</CustomH4>

For more conversational parts, such as Home cards, marketing copy, and empty states, use the article. This makes the language sound more approachable and helps users understand complex concepts they encounter for the first time.

| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage |
| --- | --- | 
| Start building your website by adding a text element to a blank section. | Start building your website by adding text element to blank section. |

<CustomH4>Call-to-action </CustomH4>

On buttons, action-oriented dialog titles, and menu titles, you can drop the article.

| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage |
| --- | --- | 
| Add menu item | Add a menu item |
| Upload video? | Upload a video? |

### 5. Capitalization

<CustomH4>Sentence case</CustomH4>

<CustomH5> 1. In most cases, the content in the platform is in the form of Sentence Case, such as a paragraph of text, a sentence, a title, and UI elements (button names, labels, menus, etc.)</CustomH5>

| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage|
| --- | --- | 
| Create project | Create a Project |

<CustomH5> 2. Sentences starting with a number, the first letter does not need to be capitalized</CustomH5>

| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage |
| --- | --- | 
| 2 results found | 2 Results found|


<CustomH5> 3. A letter after a slash needs to be capitalized</CustomH5>

| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage |
| --- | --- | 
| Country/Region | Country/region |
| Turn on the On/Off toggle. | Turn on the On/off toggle.|


<CustomH4>Title Case</CustomH4>

Usually, when referring to proper nouns, the way Title Case is used is reasonable.

<CustomH5> 1. Proper nouns, such as terms, brand names, platform names, function names, trademarks, etc., must be capitalized</CustomH5>


| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage |
| --- | --- |  
| Do you want to return Yves Saint Laurent lipstick? | Do you want to return Yves saint laurent lipstick? | 

- When the person's name follows the job title and title, the first letter of the word must be capitalized, such as UX Writer, Jackie, Headmaster Li, etc.

<CustomH5> 2. Other cases</CustomH5>

- **proper noun** need to be capitalized anywhere in the interface
- a, an, prepositions such as on, to, in, up, down, of, for, etc., and, but, or, not, yet, etc., do not need to be capitalized at any time except at the first letter of the segment
- For multiple words connected by hyphens, the first letter of each content word is capitalized, and the first letter of function words is lowercase, such as Starling-in-Context
- For file names suffixed with `.xlsx`, **<u>underscore</u>** is used to separate each word in English, and **Title Case** rules are used for capitalization, such as Salary_Data_Repair_Template.xlsx
- If the English in parentheses is a complete sentence, the first letter is capitalized; if it is not a complete sentence, the first letter is lowercase

### 6. Contractions 

Abbreviations are abbreviations for words, such as: what's, where's, we'll, we're, you'll, you're, they're, doesn't, didn't, isn't, aren't or can't. We use abbreviations to create a relaxed and human tone.
- Abbreviations are recommended as they make the content more conversational
- Don't use informal abbreviations like: ain't, y'all
- Don't use less common abbreviations like: would've, could've, it'll
- Be careful when abbreviating "is," "does," "has," "was," because their abbreviations are similar to possessives (such as "John's shirt"), making the information less readable. For example👇

| ✅ Recommended usage | ❌ Deprecated usage |
| --- | --- |  
| maxattacks is currently livestreaming | maxattacks's currently livestreaming | 

- For some sensitive or serious information, such as error information or account closure information, try to avoid using abbreviated forms, but put the clarity of the information and the respect for the situation first

### 7. Emoji

Avoid emoji, opt for an icon instead; use it at the end of a segment if you must.

### 8. Date and Time

<CustomH4>Unified specification</CustomH4>

- Use 24-hour clock to represent time, such as 07:00, 21:00, do not use am, pm

<CustomH4>Date</CustomH4>


> Example: Jan 1, 2018, 2018–01–01

- If there is enough space, write the date in full. Such as: March 12, 2020
- If space is limited, the month can be abbreviated. Such as: Mar 12, 2020
- Use dashes – (Option and -) to connect year, month and day, do not use / , such as: en: 03/01/2022; zh: 2022-03-01
- Month abbreviations use three letters, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr
- Months cannot be abbreviated when not used to represent a date. Such as: Registered at Septemter
- Avoid using numeric abbreviations for dates, such as "first" "1st" "23rd"
- A module can only use one time format
- The calendar starts on Monday, which is the custom in most parts of the world

<CustomH4>Timestamp</CustomH4>

Follow the example below to use a consistent timestamp format.
*** 
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>less than 1 minute</td>
        <td>Just now</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1–60 minutes</td>
        <td>13 minutes ago</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Today</td>
        <td>10:30 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Yesterday</td>
        <td>Yesterday at 10:30</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>08–14 10:30 </td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>more than 1 year</td>
        <td>Aug 14, 2016 at 10:30 </td>
        <td>2016–08–14 10:30 </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<CustomH4>Time Range</CustomH4>

In principle, both the tilde "~" and the dash "-" can indicate a range. Since there is already "-" in the time to distinguish the table, use "~" uniformly.
> Example: 2020-02-06 ~ 2020-02-08

<CustomH4>Duration</CustomH4>

| Time dimension |  English format |
| --- |  --- |
| second |  5sec / 5s |
| minute |  20min 5sec / 20m 5s |
| hour | 23hrs 8min 5sec / 23h 8m 5s|
| day |  3 days |
| week | 1 week |
| month |  3 months |
| year |1 year |

- If the timing is displayed in the middle of a sentence (such as in a banner), use the form to display the specific time unit
- If the countdown unit exceeds 24 hours, display the day and hour, such as "2 days 1:50"
- If the duration is up to days, display the hours, such as "1 hour 50 minutes"
- If the maximum time is up to points, display the points, such as "50 points"

### 9. e.g., i.e, etc. 

Avoid Latin abbreviations, as these abbreviations may not be understood by everyone.

| --- | ---|
| for example, such as | e.g. |
| that is | i.e. |
| Add sounds, effects, stickers and more. | Add sounds, effects, stickers, etc. |

### 10. Lists 

- Use lists to increase the readability of information. If the list is a complete statement, use proper punctuation. Try to ensure that the list content is less than or equal to six. If the list contains more than six items, try dividing it into multiple lists
- To make your list more local, start with an introductory statement and end with a colon ":". Try to avoid repeating phrases, and if some word is relevant to all the list contents, try putting it in the introductory statement
