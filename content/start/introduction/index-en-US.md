## What is Semi

Semi Design is a design system designed, developed and maintained by the Douyin front-end team and the MED product design team. As a comprehensive, easy-to-use, and high-quality modern enterprise-level application UI solution, it is refined from the complex scenes of byte beating various business lines, supports nearly a thousand platform products, and serves 100,000+ internal and external users.  
After nearly two years of iteration, Semi Design has become a cross-departmental infrastructure after various types of business landing verification, and has formed a rich tool chain and ecology around the component library. In order to allow the increasingly mature design system to serve more users and to further explore the usage scenarios, we decided to open source Semi and use the power of the community to continuously improve and expand the capability boundary.

## Our vision

Semi is mostly used in prefixes or phrases to mean "half"-just like a complete enterprise application, which usually consists of business logic and front-end interface, Semi Design hopes to become an indispensable half of this and provide a solid and high-quality front-end for enterprise applications The basics.  
We believe that the real value of the design system lies in reducing the cost of front-end construction, while providing excellent design and engineering standards, fully liberating the productivity of designers and developers, so as to continuously incubate star products.

### Design -- unchanged and changeable

In recent years, more and more SaaS products such as Slack, Notion, Figma have begun to rely on excellent user experience to drive growth. The evaluation criteria for products have gradually shifted from the purchaser to the end user; the quality of a product experience will directly affect whether the user continues to use it, and the experience design of the B-end product has become more and more important.  
Semi Design is always committed to improving the experience of enterprise applications. By refining simple and lightweight, modern design style, meticulously polishing the interaction of atomic components, and iterating under the massive business scenarios of byte beating, a set of high-quality default foundations have been deposited-it will ensure the enterprise application products created by Semi , Born with a consistent "language" and a quality baseline that is significantly better than the old system.  
In addition, a good design system must be "live", it needs to be able to develop and update with the growth of the business. Therefore, Semi has never tried to constrain users and solidify the so-called "unified specifications". Instead, on the basis of default, it fully implements modular decoupling and opens up customization capabilities to facilitate the secondary tailoring and customization of users, and the construction is suitable for different Front-end assets of morphological products.

Adhere to the high-quality and stable default foundation (unchanged), and fully open the flexibility of customization (variable) when needed, this is the unique design principle of Semi Design and will always follow.

### Theming —— Brand one-click customization

How does Semi become flexible and changeable on the basis of coherence and unity? The answer is a powerful theming program.  
By layering and sorting out thousands of design variables (Design Token), designers and developers can deeply customize the presentation layer at the global and even component level-even if you don’t know CSS, you can use the theme editor (DSM), to create a style that meets the diverse visual needs of the business and brand. Developers can publish and replace with one click through the npm package, which is easy to customize and easy to manage.  
You can check Semi's official sample themes in different brand scenarios such as Douyin, Cut Ying, Feishu, Volcano Engine, etc. in [Semi DSM](https://semi.design/dsm/store)

Within this year, we will also realize real-time synchronization of themes from online to design tools-while improving efficiency, we will further ensure the continuous alignment of design and R&D, and reduce the cost of communication between production and research.

### Dark Mode

In order to be compatible with the preferences of more user groups in different production environments, as a supplement to the light color mode, any theme of Semi Design automatically supports the dark mode and can be dynamically switched when the application is running.  
Not only that, Semi also allows users to enable dark mode in some areas of the app to be compatible with the use scenarios of SDK or plug-in products. Through advanced settings, users can also realize that the application and system themes are automatically consistent. At the same time, in order to further enhance the development experience, we also provide a cli tool for one-click compatibility of unstandardized stock old projects to Semi dark mode, avoiding migration costs in an automated way.

### Foundation / Adapter

Semi Design adopts a set of cross web framework technical solutions, F/A layered design, splits the JavaScript of each component into two parts: Foundation and Adapter, which allows us to reuse Foundation code across frameworks by re-implementing only the adapter , Such as React, Vue, Angular, Svelte or WebComponent, quickly build common component libraries on different platforms.

![F/A](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/ptlz_zlp/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/tech-doc/engSemi.jpg)

Foundation Foundation contains the business logic that best represents the interaction of Semi Design components, and does not actually reference any DOM elements. Foundation delegates Adapter methods for any logic that requires DOM manipulation.

Adaptor Adapter is an interface that has all the methods required by Foundation to implement Semi Design business logic, and is responsible for 1. Component DOM structure declaration 2. Responsible for all DOM operation/update related logic, usually using framework APIs for setState, getState, addEventListener , RemoveListener and other operations. Adapters can have many implementations, allowing interoperability with different frameworks.

At present, we have implemented the React version of Adapter. You can use our React components directly by install `semi-ui`. If you are interested in Semi's architecture design, you can read this article for more detail [How to hierarchically design the UI component library so that it has the ability to adapt to multiple mvvm frameworks](https://bytedance.feishu.cn/docs/doccnTgc0iGOVPubHZkwPpxXSNh#)。

### Internationalization - Diversity and compatibility

Under the practice of ByteDance globalization business, Semi Design has undergone 30+ version iterations and has perfect internationalization features-covering 10+ languages such as simplified/traditional Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, etc., and date and time components are provided Global time zone support, all components can automatically adapt to the Arabic RTL layout.  
At the same time, with the expansion of business, developers in all regions of the world have begun to use Semi to build applications. In order to better support the demands of these users, we have also adapted the site and documents bilingually to ensure barrier-free development.

## Roadmap

In the next year, the Semi Design team will continue to improve and optimize the quality, and open more internally implemented tool chains and resources to community users, including but not limited to:

### Material market

In the past year, users of Bytedance's internal business line teams have independently designed and developed a wide variety of UI materials including forms, multimedia, user guidance, message notifications, charts, etc., around the basic components of Semi, and released them in the material market. Semi users can search for materials and reuse them based on product requirements, greatly saving development costs; at the same time, high-quality UI resources can also be accumulated and disseminated.  
The material community will meet with you soon. At that time, we will open source the high-quality materials together, open the material release process to community users, and provide development guidelines.

### Design to Code

For a long time, the Semi team has been trying to optimize daily work processes through various automated means, help team designers and R&D to improve efficiency, and even redefine traditional working methods. Among them, the "front-end page restoration" link has various inefficiencies such as time-consuming and high communication costs, which has always been the focus of our attention.  
At present, we have implemented a simple translation of static page design drafts, and have been effectively verified in scenarios such as landing pages. In fact, the official website of https://semi.design is developed and restored with the help of this solution.  
In the future, the Design to Code program will complete component-level identification and translation through code scanning. At the same time, combined with the page templates deposited by the team from a large number of business scenarios, users will be able to quickly complete the cloning and structural restoration of the front-end page at a very low cost.

### A11y

Semi always pays attention to Web accessibility. At present, we have achieved some accessibility support in terms of semantic labeling, color wheel algorithm contrast, text perception, etc., but we believe that there is still a lot of room for improvement. We will continue to pay attention to and improve the operability and perceptibility of components in the future, provide more convenient keyboard interaction for mouse-based operations, and provide more complete WAI-ARIA support.

### Cross WebFramework

High scalability, as Semi's core design principle, runs through Semi's code architecture design, API design, style layer abstraction and other aspects. Thanks to the Foundation/Adapter architecture design and the principle of layering style files, Semi is very easy to migrate to other front-end frameworks. In version 2.0, we rewrite Semi based on Typescript, hoping to still have a good development experience and quality assurance in the process of multi-frame migration and adaptation. The Foundation layer is also open source based on the MIT protocol, and we will always maintain the framework independence of its code implementation in future iterations. If you expect to bring Semi Design to more platform frameworks, we welcome you to reuse it directly. At this stage, our team will focus on the React system, but WebComponent is also one of the directions we focus on. The timing is right in the future, and we will make more attempts, so stay tuned.
